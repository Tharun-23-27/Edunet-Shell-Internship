## 📘 Project Title  
**Smart Waste Classification System using CNN**

---

## 🧭 Problem Statement  
The increasing waste generation in urban areas poses a serious threat to environmental sustainability.  
Improper segregation and disposal of waste contribute to land, air, and water pollution.  
With growing industrialization and population density, manual waste sorting has become inefficient, reducing recycling efficiency and increasing environmental harm.  

There is a pressing need for an automated and intelligent solution that can streamline waste classification and promote sustainable waste management practices.

---

## 💡 Project Concept  
This project focuses on developing a **Smart Waste Classification System** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** — a deep learning algorithm for image recognition.  

The system aims to automatically classify waste images into categories such as **plastic, metal, paper, glass, and organic waste**.  
By accurately identifying the waste type, it can support **automated sorting**, **recycling**, and **sustainability goals**.

---

## 🧠 Objectives  
- To design and train a CNN model capable of classifying waste images.  
- To create or collect a dataset of different waste types.  
- To promote sustainable waste management through AI-based automation.

## 🗂️ Dataset Information  
**Dataset Name:** Garbage Classification Dataset  
**Source:** [Kaggle – Garbage Classification v2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumn2u/garbage-classification-v2)  

### About the Dataset  
This dataset contains thousands of labeled images of garbage items divided into **10 categories**.  
It is ideal for building machine learning and computer vision models for recycling and waste management.  
It provides high-quality, diverse images for accurate classification and sustainability-focused research.

## 🔄 Next Steps  
1. **Collect & Prepare Dataset** – Download and organize the dataset for training and validation.  
2. **Train the CNN Model** – Use **Google Teachable Machine** or **Google Colab** for model development.  
3. **Evaluate & Test Model** – Measure performance and accuracy metrics.  
4. **Build Web Interface** – Create an easy-to-use web app for classification (using Streamlit).  
5. **Test the Complete Application** – Validate with unseen test images.  
6. **Deploy & Document** – Upload project files and reports to GitHub.
